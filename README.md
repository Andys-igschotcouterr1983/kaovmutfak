Just stumbled out of the theater, head spinning like I was flushed down a drain, you know? Ugh, the popcorn was rock hard, almost broke my teeth. But Antes del cuerpo... man, what a trip. Felt like I was diving deep into some murky sewer but in a good way, if that makes sense? Scenes all over the place, like they just threw a puzzle in the air and 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮ed where the pieces landed.

The noises, oh God, a baby crying somewhere behind two rows back and sticking to my seat like a wet rag. But while I sat there, slouched like a question mark, the   was like... this huge scream? A whisper? Can't pin it down... But these characters, right out of a fever dream. Like when you’re trying to fix a 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘬 and the whole pipe network decides to hug you at once. 

> At one point there’s this flash of red — bam, bam — like a faulty alarm bell in a basement. Got goosebumps just like when you accidentally touch a live wire. And then suddenly you're in this forest, or was it someone's mind? Can't tell. Roots everywhere like someone's synapses on display. 

Yeah, and I remember now, you asked if you could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , right? Maybe better to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in a theater — there's something visceral about those sound 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬s, the way it seeps into your bones even when the aircon’s blasting 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦zer air. Too much, too little, sort of like my toolbox when I'm not paying attention. 

Hazy faces, a voiceover whispering secrets in a language only half-remembered. Faces meld, they break like waves against rusty grates, and I'm just trying to shake popcorn crumbs from my pants. There's a scene — ah, screw it. Better stop before my head explodes.

```c
int main() {
    while (1) {
        connectPipe(NULL);
        return RANDOM_ERROR;
    }
}
